bill gates helped usher in the digital  revolution at microsoft and has spent the  
decade since exploring and investing in innovative  solutions to some of the world's toughest problems  
global poverty disease and the coronavirus  pandemic which he spent nearly two billion dollars  
on now he's focusing on climate change agreeing  with the overwhelming majority of scientists  
who warn of a looming climate disaster the good  news is gates believes it's possible to prevent  
a catastrophic rise in temperatures the bad news  he says in the next 30 years we need scientific  
breakthroughs technological innovations and global  cooperation on a scale the world has never seen  
the story will continue in a moment
you believe this is the toughest challenge  humanity has ever faced absolutely the amount of  
change uh new ideas it's way greater than the  pandemic and it needs a level of cooperation  
that would be unprecedented that doesn't  sound no it's not easy uh but hey 30 years  
we have more educated people than ever we have  a generation that's speaking out on this topic  
uh and you know i got to participate in the  miracle of the personal computer and the  
internet and so yes i have a bias to believe  innovation can do these things he's talking  
about innovations in every aspect of modern  life manufacturing agriculture transportation  
because nearly everything we now do releases  earth-warming greenhouse gases mainly carbon  
dioxide into the atmosphere he took us to his  favorite burger joint in seattle to explain  
you're talking about changing everything in the  economy i mean every aspect yeah the physical of  
what we can see right now of us sitting around  here what specifically would be impacted well  
this cement uh would be made in a different way  the steel in the building would be different  
you know the meat and the burger is a big  deal these you know all this plastic and paper  
potatoes with potatoes you're talking about  fertilizer the irrigation system that's used  
all the tractors the transport trucks  that bring them to this restaurant  
all that has to change hey when you're going to  zero it you don't get to skip anything gates says  
going to zero means eliminating all greenhouse gas  emissions or else if they wait a hundred years to  
do this it's way too late uh then the natural  ecosystems will have failed the instability uh  
you know the migration you know those things will  will get really really bad well before the end of  
the century when you talk about migration you're  talking about hundreds of thousands of people  
trying to move from north africa to europe every  year exactly the syrian war was a 20th of what  
climate migration will look like so the deaths per  year are way 10 times greater than than what we've  
experienced in the pandemic in a new book how to  avoid a climate disaster gates outlines all the  
solutions he believes we need he says the u.s has  to lead the world getting to zero greenhouse gas  
emissions by 2050. he supports president biden's  decision to rejoin the paris climate agreement but  
is asking the administration to massively increase  the budget for climate and clean energy research  
to 35 billion dollars a year you've said  that governments need to do the hard stuff  
but not just go after the low-hanging  fruit what's low-hanging fruit  
passenger cars part of the electric generation  with renewables the things everybody knows about  
that's getting almost all the money not the hard  parts which is the industrial piece including the  
steel and cement those pieces we've hardly started  to work on no one thinks much about cement and  
steel but making it accounts for 16 percent of all  carbon dioxide emissions and the demand is only  
growing the world will add an estimated two and  a half trillion square feet of buildings by 2060  
that's the equivalent to putting up another new  york city every month for the next 40 years so one  
innovative company gates has been pouring money  into is carbon cure they inject captured carbon  
dioxide into concrete what they do is they stick  co2 in here and the cement and they mix them up  
and so you're able to actually get rid  of some co2 by sticking it in the cement  
right now they get rid of about five percent but  they have a next generation they can get to 30  
percent the carbon has been just injected into  this so it's captured it so it's not going to be  
released into the atmosphere that's right gates  has already invested two billion dollars of his  
own money on new green technologies and plans  to spend several billion more in 2016 he also  
recruited jeff bezos mike bloomberg and nearly two  dozen other wealthy investors to back a billion  
dollar fund called breakthrough energy ventures  making long-term often risky investments in  
promising technologies it kind of blows my mind  you know what's the cost of making that stuff  
gates regularly consults with the fund's team  of top scientists and entrepreneurs who've so  
far invested in 50 companies with cutting-edge  ideas to reduce carbon emissions what's like  
the most far-flung idea you've backed there's  one that's so crazy it's even hard to describe
it's so crazy it's hard to describe even yeah  how do you pitch that to investors they find  
geological formations and they just pump water  down into them the energy they've used uh to  
pump it in then they can draw that energy back  out so it's it's a water pressure storage thing  
which you know when i first thought i thought  that can't work but but you gave money to it  
yeah lots of money because cows account for  around four percent of all greenhouse gases gates  
has invested in two companies making plant-based  meat substitutes impossible foods and beyond meat  
but farming the vegetables used to make  many meat alternatives emits gases as well  
so gates is also backing a company that's  created an entirely new food source  
this company nature's find is using fungi  and then they turn them into sausage and  
yogurt pretty amazing when you say fungi do you  mean like a mushroom or a microbe it's a microbe  
the microbe was discovered in the ground in  a geyser in yellowstone national park without  
soil or fertilizer it can be grown to produce  this nutritional protein that can then be turned  
into a variety of foods with a small carbon  footprint this is the yogurt oh this is good  
wow i've had like cashew yogurt or oat yogurt it's  sort of along those lines yeah with the burgers  
they're you know like beyond impossible they're  getting close to real thing but you can still tell  
these i'm not sure i could tell no i'm more  of a burger expert than i am a yogurt gates  
never planned to focus on climate change but while  working in africa with the foundation he started  
with his wife melinda in 2000 he came to see just  how vulnerable those in developing countries are  
to the effects of rising temperatures so 15 years  ago gates started educating himself on climate  
change bringing scientists and engineers to his  office in seattle for what he calls learning  
sessions he also reads voraciously books and  binders full of scientific research yeah so  
this is the most recent one which is about clean  hydrogen so you're reading thousands of pages  
every few days on topics yeah my reading is is  key and then asking questions when it it doesn't  
make sense gates isn't just looking to cut future  carbon emissions he's also investing in direct air  
capture an experimental process to remove existing  co2 from the atmosphere some companies are now  
using these giant fans to capture co2 directly  out of the air gates has become one of the world's  
largest funders of this kind of technology but of  all his green investments gates has spent the most  
time and money pursuing a breakthrough in nuclear  energy arguing it's key to a zero-carbon future  
he says he's a big believer in wind and solar and  thinks it can one day provide up to 80 percent of  
the country's electricity but gates insists  unless we discover an effective way to store  
and ship wind and solar energy nuclear power will  likely have to do the rest energy from nuclear  
plants can be stored so it's available when the  sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing  
were you always a big proponent of nuclear  in 2008 he founded terrapower a company that  
has redesigned a nuclear reactor this is your  prototype exactly terrapower's naturing reactor  
uh this is a rendering we haven't built it  yet but here's the nuclear island right here  
this is the reactor exactly gate says  terrapower's reactor is less expensive to build  
produces less waste and is fully automated  reducing the potential for human error gates  
and director of engineering lindsey boles showed  us what they say is another key to its safety  
what is it that we're looking at here so these  individual fuel pins are actually where the  
uranium fuel is and that's what generates all the  heat in our natrium reactor this is what everybody  
is worried about yes exactly in a normal reactor  it's water that's flowing past and heating up  
and it'll boil and generate a lot of high pressure  that high heat and pressure can cause an explosion  
like in chernobyl in 1986 when radioactive  material was spread for thousands of miles but  
gates says the pteropower reactor won't use water  to cool down the fuel rods they plan to use liquid  
sodium the liquid sodium can absorb a lot more  heat and so we we don't have any high pressure  
inside the reactor in october the department of  energy awarded terror power 80 million dollars to  
build one of the first advanced nuclear reactors  in the u.s nuclear power can be done in a way that  
none of those uh failures of the past would  recur because just the physics of how it's built  
i admit convincing people of that will be  almost as hard as actually building it but  
since it may be necessary to avoid climate change  we shouldn't give up you've been criticized for  
being a technocrat saying technology is the only  solution for for tackling climate change there  
are other people say look the solution's already  there it's just government policy is what really  
needs to be focused on i wish that was true i  wish all this funding of these companies wasn't  
necessary at all without innovation we will not  solve climate change we won't even come close  
gates credits young activists for keeping  climate change in the headlines but he knows some  
consider him an imperfect ally are you the right  messenger on this because you fly private planes  
a lot and you're creating a lot of greenhouse  gases yourself yeah i'd probably have one of  
the highest greenhouse gas footprints  of anyone on the planet you know my my  
personal flying uh alone is gigantic now i'm  spending quite a bit uh to buy aviation fuel  
uh that was made with plants you know i switched  to an electric car i've used solar panels  
i'm paying a company that actually at a very high  price can pull a bit of carbon out of the air  
and stick it underground and so i'm offsetting  my personal emissions those are called carbon  
offsets right so you know it's costing like 400 a  ton it's like 7 million dollars so you're paying 7  
million a year to offset your carbon footprint yep  he's encouraging others who can afford it to buy  
carbon offsets and green products so that what he  calls the green premium the added production costs  
for reducing carbon emissions will go down and  quality of products up driving the innovations  
that may get us to zero it just seems overwhelming  if every aspect of our daily life has to change it  
can seem overwhelming but you are optimistic yeah  there are days when it looks very hard if people  
think it's easy they're wrong if people think  it's impossible they're wrong it's possible it's  
possible but it'll be the most amazing thing  mankind has ever done that's what it has to  
be yeah it's an all-out effort you know like a  world war but it's us against greenhouse gases
