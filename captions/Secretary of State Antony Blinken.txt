in his first 100 days president biden focused on  the coronavirus pandemic but over the course of  
his term the biden presidency will be defined  by how the united states competes with china  
in a few years china's economy is expected  to surpass the u.s as the world's biggest  
to determine how the united states will deal with  china's growing influence mr biden has chosen one  
of his closest aides as secretary of state it  falls to anthony blinken to rebuild a depleted  
and demoralized state department repair u.s  alliances and champion what diplomats call the  
rules-based international order the written and  unwritten code that governs how nations deal with  
one another rules that he says are now threatened  by china the story will continue in a moment
it is the one country in the world that has  the military economic diplomatic uh capacity to  
undermine or challenge the rules-based order that  we uh we care so much about and are determined  
to defend but i want to be very clear about  something and this is important our purpose is not  
to contain china to hold it back to keep it  down it is to uphold this rules-based order  
that china is posing a challenge to anyone who  poses a challenge to that order we're going to  
stand up and defend it i know you say the goal is  not to contain china but have you ever seen china  
be so assertive or aggressive militarily no we  haven't i think what we've witnessed over the last  
several years is china acting more repressively at  home and more aggressively abroad that is a fact  
what's china's goal i think that over time  china believes that it it can be and should  
be and will be the dominant country in the world  chinese fighter jets are increasingly visible  
Military confrontation with China
in the skies above the western pacific  where the u.s navy also has a presence  
this past week china's president xi unveiled  three new warships to patrol the south china sea  
it already has the world's largest navy and could  use it to invade taiwan a democratic island and  
long-standing u.s ally do you think we're heading  towards some sort of military confrontation with  
china i think it's profoundly against the  interests of both china and the united states  
uh to uh to get to that point or even to  head in that direction let's talk about human  
rights describe what you see it's happening in  xinjiang that maybe the rest of the world doesn't  
we've made clear that um we see a genocide having  taken place against uh the uyghurs in xinjiang  
more than a million people have been put  into choose your term concentration camps  
re-education camps internment camps when  beijing says oh there's a terrorism threat  
which we don't see it's not coming from a million  people our administration six weeks ago in alaska  
Human rights
secretary blinken confronted young giache  china's top diplomat about genocide in xinjiang  
and china's military aggression we feel an  obligation to raise these issues here today
the exchange became an international incident  caught on camera and not lost in translation  
the united states does not have the qualification  to say that it wants to speak to china from a  
position of strength if shinzone is in a red line  with china then what is look we don't have the  
luxury of not dealing with china there are real  complexities to the relationship whether it's the  
adversarial piece whether it's the competitive  piece whether it's the the cooperative piece  
USChina relationship
even before the meeting in alaska president  xi had warned about the dawn of a new cold war  
during president trump's time in office  china found the u.s less predictable than  
past administrations and i just announced another  10 tariffs mr trump imposed tariffs on hundreds  
of billions of dollars of chinese products in  response to what he called unfair trade practices  
and the theft of u.s intellectual property so far  the biden administration has kept the tariffs in  
place i also told president xi that we'll maintain  a strong military presence china may be the only  
big issue of the day in washington in which  democrats and republicans find common cause  
the chinese have stolen hundreds of billions  if not trillions of dollars of trade secrets  
and intellectual property from the united states  that sounds like the actions of an enemy certainly  
sounds like the actions of of someone who's  trying to compete unfairly uh and increasingly in  
adversarial ways but we're much more effective  and stronger when we're bringing like-minded  
and similarly aggrieved countries together to say  to beijing this can't stand and it won't stand  
so is that a message that president biden has  delivered to president xi certainly in their in  
their first conversation uh they covered a lot  of ground it was a reportedly a two-hour phone  
call it was yeah i was there and so did president  biden tell president xi to cut it out president  
biden made clear that in a number of areas we have  real concerns about the actions that china has  
taken and that includes in the economic area and  that includes the theft of intellectual property  
china's gross domestic product is expected  to surpass the united states as early as 2028  
well it's a large country it's got a lot of  people if china becomes the wealthiest country  
in the world doesn't that also make it the most  powerful a lot depends on how it uses that wealth  
it has an aging population it has significant  uh environmental problems and so on but here's  
the way i think about it nor writ large if we're  talking about what really makes the wealth of a  
nation fundamentally it's it's human resources and  the ability of any one country to maximize their  
potential that's the challenge uh for us it's the  challenge for china i think we're in a much better  
place to maximize that uh that human potential  than any country on earth if we're smart about it  
china thinks long-term strategically decades  in advance is america just caught up on  
the latest fires here and there and we're not  thinking long term strategically and as a result  
china will surpass us what i  found looking at our own history  
is that when we've confronted a significant  challenge significant competition uh significant  
adversity we've managed to come together and  actually do the long-term thinking the long-term  
investment and that is really the moment we're in  now and that's the test that i think we're facing  
are we actually going to rise to  it president biden believes we are  
Biden relationship
anthony blinken occupies a suite of offices  on the seventh floor of the state department  
but he first worked for joe biden at the senate  foreign relations committee nearly 20 years ago  
and has barely left his side since in the obama  white house secretary blinken held concurrent  
roles as an assistant to the president and the  national security advisor for vice president biden  
it's been the most consequential professional  relationship and and also in many ways personal  
relationship uh that i've uh that i've had how  often do you speak it's pretty close to daley you  
speak to him every day in one way or another  you know we're we're pretty good at meetings  
so there are a few of those when i thought  about the relationship that you have had  
with with president biden over the years in  the senate and then when he was vice president  
the only relationship that i could come up with  though i'm not a historian um was of course  
secretary baker and president george h.w bush  i'd be flattered by any comparison to secretary  
baker i actually i spoke to him on the phone a few  months ago and we talked about the importance of  
ideally a secretary of state having a close  relationship with uh with the president  
he was extraordinarily effective for all  sorts of reasons but that was i think a source  
of his effectiveness secretary of state  james baker helped president george h.w bush  
Afghanistan
end the cold war with the soviet union the  current secretary is in the midst of winding  
down america's longest war in afghanistan are you  prepared for a worst case scenario in afghanistan  
where the u.s backed government fails  and the taliban takes over we have to  
be prepared for every scenario and there are a  range of them and uh we we're looking at this  
uh in a very clear-eyed way but nora we've  been engaged in afghanistan for 20 years and  
we sometimes forget why we went there in the first  place and that was to deal with the people who  
attacked us on 9 11. and we did just because our  troops are coming home doesn't mean we're leaving  
we're not our embassy's staying the support that  we're giving to afghanistan when it comes to  
economic support development humanitarian that  that remains and not only from us from partners  
and allies somewhat related will the biden  administration close guantanamo bay we believe  
that it should be that's certainly a goal but  it's something that we'll bring some focus to in  
the months ahead in this past wednesday's address  to congress president biden spoke about his plans  
Immigration
for immigration reform for more than 30 years  politicians have talked about immigration reform  
and we've done nothing about it it's time to fix  it it's a subject not usually central to the state  
department's mission but we asked secretary  blinken about it because of the refugee crisis  
on america's southern border border crossings  for undocumented immigrants have skyrocketed  
in march more than a hundred and seventy thousand  people were taken into custody that's the highest  
in 20 years are the policies of  the bidet administration to blame  
no what we're seeing is indeed a surge of people  to the border we've seen that in the past but  
we inherited a totally broken system uh broken  intentionally and it takes time to fix it and by  
the way our message is very clear don't come the  border is not open you won't get in but we have to  
understand what is motivating so many people to do  this and it is usually desperation but that's not  
new i want to talk about the policies of the biden  administration because president biden did use his  
executive authority to curb deportations to allow  more asylum seekers to enter the united states  
so are these new policies by the administration  contributing to this surge we're focused when it  
comes to people coming into making sure that that  children unaccompanied minors are treated humanely  
and according to the law is it problematic  to tell migrants well no you can't come here  
and then at the same time create a different  situation on the ground that does allow them  
to come but the point is that they're not and  what's one of the challenges that uh that we've  
had is that um traffickers and others are trying  to tell them that the border is open it's not but  
children are being allowed in and they're being  children are the one exception because we we will  
not it is the it is the right thing to do we are  not going to abide the notion that children are  
kept in a precarious dangerous situation that is  unacceptable blinken himself is a father of two  
Ukraine
young children and hails from a family that only  a few generations ago were themselves refugees his  
paternal great grandfather meyer blinken emigrated  to new york city from ukraine fleeing russian  
oppression in 1904 this coming week the secretary  of state will visit ukraine to show support for  
the country currently in the throes of more recent  russian aggression president putin has amassed a  
very large force at the border with ukraine more  than a hundred thousand troops what is putin up to
you're right there are more forces massed on  the border with ukraine than any time since  
2014 when russia actually invaded i can't  tell you that we know mr putin's intentions  
there are any number of things that he could  do or or choose not to do what we have seen in  
the last few days is apparently a decision to  pull back some of those forces and we've seen some  
of them in fact start to pull back that's been  verified that they are pulling back starting now  
we're watching that very very carefully
