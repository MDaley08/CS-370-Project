her name is francis haugen that is a fact that  facebook has been anxious to know since last month  
when an anonymous former employee filed complaints  with federal law enforcement the complaints say  
facebook's own research shows that it amplifies  hate misinformation and political unrest but the  
company hides what it knows one complaint alleges  that facebook's instagram harms teenage girls  
what makes haugen's complaints unprecedented is  the trove of private facebook research she took  
when she quit in may the documents appeared first  last month in the wall street journal but tonight  
frances haugen is revealing her identity to  explain why she became the facebook whistleblower  
the story will continue in a moment
the thing i saw at facebook over and over again  was there were conflicts of interest between what  
was good for the public and what was good for  facebook and facebook over and over again chose  
to optimize for its own interests like making more  money francis haugen is 37 a data scientist from  
iowa with a degree in computer engineering and a  harvard master's degree in business for 15 years  
she's worked for companies including google and  pinterest i've seen a bunch of social networks  
and it was substantially worse at facebook than  anything i'd seen before you know someone else  
might have just quit and moved on and i wonder why  you take this stand imagine you know what's going  
on inside facebook and you know no one on the  outside knows i knew what my future looked like  
if i continued to stay inside of facebook which is  person after person after person has tackled this  
inside of facebook and ground themselves to the  ground when and how did it occur to you to take  
all of these documents out of the company at some  point in 2021 i realized okay i'm going to have  
to do this in a systemic way and i have to get out  enough that no one can question that this is real  
she secretly copied tens of thousands  of pages of facebook internal research  
she says evidence shows that the company is lying  to the public about making significant progress  
against hate violence and misinformation one study  she found from this year says we estimate that we  
may action as little as three to five percent  of hate and about six tenths of one percent of  
violence and incitement on facebook despite  being the best in the world at it to quote  
from another one of the documents you brought  out we have evidence from a variety of sources  
that hate speech divisive political speech and  misinformation on facebook and the family of apps  
are affecting societies around the world when  we live in an information environment that is  
full of angry hateful polarizing content it erodes  our civic trust it erodes our faith in each other  
it erodes our ability to want to care for each  other the version of facebook that exists today  
is tearing our societies apart and  causing ethnic violence around the world  
ethnic violence including myanmar in 2018 when  the military used facebook to launch a genocide  
the first quarter of 2019. francis haugen told  us she was recruited by facebook in 2019 she  
says she agreed to take the job only if she could  work against misinformation because she had lost  
a friend to online conspiracy theories i never  wanted anyone to feel the pain that i had felt  
and i had seen how high the stakes were in terms  of making sure there was high quality information  
on facebook at headquarters she was assigned  to civic integrity which worked on risks to  
elections including misinformation but after  this past election there was a turning point  
they told us we're dissolving civic integrity  like they basically said oh good we made it  
through the election there wasn't riots we can get  rid of civic integrity now fast forward a couple  
months we got the insurrection and when they got  rid of civic integrity it was the moment where  
i was like i don't trust that they're willing to  actually invest what needs to be invested to keep  
facebook from being dangerous facebook says  the work of civic integrity was distributed to  
other units haugen told us the root of facebook's  problem is in a change that it made in 2018 to its  
algorithms the programming that decides  what you see on your facebook news feed  
so you know you have your phone you might see  only 100 pieces of content if you sit and scroll  
off for you know five minutes but facebook  has thousands of options it could show you  
the algorithm picks from those options based on  the kind of content you've engaged with the most  
in the past and one of the consequences of how  facebook is picking out that content today is it  
is optimizing for content that gets engagement  or reaction but its own research is showing  
that content that is hateful that is divisive that  is polarizing it's easier to inspire people to  
anger than it is to other emotions misinformation  angry content is enticing to people and keeps  
them on the platform yes facebook has realized  that if they change the algorithm to be safer  
people will spend less time on the site they'll  click on less ads they'll make less money haugen  
says facebook understood the danger to the 2020  election so it turned on safety systems to reduce  
but many of those changes she says were  temporary and as soon as the election was  
over they turned them back off or they changed  the settings back to what they were before  
to prioritize growth over safety and that  really feels like a betrayal of democracy to me  
facebook says some of the safety systems remained  but after the election facebook was used by some  
to organize the january sixth insurrection  prosecutors cite facebook posts as evidence  
photos of armed partisans and texts including  by bullet or ballot restoration of the republic  
is coming extremists used many platforms but  facebook is a recurring theme after the attack  
facebook employees raged on an internal message  board copied by haugen haven't we had enough  
time to figure out how to manage discourse without  enabling violence we looked for positive comments  
and found this i don't think our leadership  team ignores data ignores dissent ignores truth  
but that drew this reply welcome to facebook  i see you just joined in november 2020  
we have been watching wishy-washy actions  of company leadership for years now  
colleagues cannot conscience working for a  company that does not do more to mitigate  
the negative effects of its platform facebook  essentially amplifies the worst of human nature  
it's one of these unfortunate consequences  right no one at facebook is malevolent but  
the incentives are misaligned right like facebook  makes more money when you consume more content  
people enjoy engaging with things that elicit an  emotional reaction and the more anger that they  
get exposed to the more they interact and more  they consume that dynamic led to a complaint to  
facebook by major political parties across europe  this 2019 internal report obtained by haugen  
says that the parties feel strongly that the  change to the algorithm has forced them to skew  
negative in their communications on facebook  leading them into more extreme policy positions  
the european political parties were essentially  saying to facebook the way you've written  
your algorithm is changing the way we lead our  countries yes you are forcing us to take positions  
that we don't like that we know are bad for  society we know if we don't take those positions  
we won't win in the marketplace of social media  evidence of harm she says extends to facebook's  
instagram app one of the facebook internal studies  that you found talks about how instagram harms  
teenage girls oh yeah one study says 13 and a  half percent of teen girls say instagram makes  
thoughts of suicide worse 17 of teen girls say  instagram makes eating disorders worse and what's  
super tragic is facebook's own research says as  these young women begin to consume this eating  
disorder content they get more and more depressed  and it actually makes them use the app more  
and so they end up in this feedback cycle  where they hate their bodies more and more  
facebook's own research says it is not  just that instagram is dangerous for  
teenagers that it harms teenagers it's that it is  distinctly worse than other forms of social media  
facebook said just last week it would postpone  plans to create an instagram for younger children  
last month haugen's lawyers filed at least  eight complaints with the securities and  
exchange commission which enforces the law in  financial markets the complaints compare the  
internal research with the company's public face  often that of ceo mark zuckerberg here testifying  
remotely to congress last march we removed content  that could lead to imminent real world harm  
we've built an unprecedented third-party  fact-checking program the system isn't perfect but  
it's the best approach that we've found to address  misinformation in line with our country's values  
one of francis haugen's lawyers is john tai he's  the founder of a washington legal group called  
whistleblower aid what is the legal theory behind  going to the sec what laws are you alleging have  
been broken as a publicly traded company facebook  is required to not lie to its investors or even  
withhold material information so the  sec regularly brings enforcement actions  
alleging that companies like facebook and others  are making material misstatements and omissions  
that affect investors adversely one of the things  that facebook might allege is that she stole  
company documents the dodd-frank act passed  over 10 years ago at this point created uh  
an office of the whistleblower inside the sec and  one of the provisions of that law says that no  
company can prohibit its employees from  from communicating with the sec and sharing  
internal corporate documents with the  sec i have a lot of empathy for mark  
and mark has never set out to make a hateful  platform but he has allowed choices to be made  
where the side effects of those choices are that  hateful polarizing content gets more distribution  
more reach facebook declined an interview but  in a written statement to 60 minutes it said  
every day our teams have to balance protecting  the right of billions of people to express  
themselves openly with the need to keep our  platform a safe and positive place we continue  
to make significant improvements to tackle the  spread of misinformation and harmful content  
to suggest we encourage bad content and do nothing  is just not true if any research had identified an  
exact solution to these complex challenges  the tech industry governments and society  
would have solved them a long time ago facebook  is a one trillion dollar company just 17 years  
old it has 2.8 billion users which is 60 percent  of all internet connected people on earth francis  
haugen plans to testify before congress this week  she believes the federal government should impose  
regulations facebook has demonstrated they cannot  act independently facebook over and over again has  
shown it uses profit over safety it is subsidizing  is paying for its profits with our safety  
i'm hoping that this will have had a big  enough impact on the world that they get  
the fortitude and the motivation to actually go  put those regulations into place that's my hope
